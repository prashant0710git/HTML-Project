      <u>The Solar System</u> is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and
      the objects that orbit it. It was formed about 4.6 billion years ago
      when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and
      a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is a typical star that maintains a
      balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core,
      releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers classify
      it as a G-type main-sequence star. The largest objects that orbit the
      Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four
      terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants
      (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All
      terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do
      not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and
      liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly
      90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn. There is a strong
      consensus among astronomers that the Solar System has at least nine
      dwarf planets: Ceres, Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong,
      Eris, and Sedna. There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies,
      such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust
      clouds. Some of these bodies are in the asteroid belt (between Mars's
      and Jupiter's orbit) and the Kuiper belt (just outside Neptune's
      orbit).[f] Six planets, seven dwarf planets, and other bodies have
      orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons'. The
      Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the
      solar wind, forming the heliosphere. This initial
      cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several
      stars. As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is
      growing brighter; early in its main-sequence life its brightness was
      70% that of what it is today. This led to dynamical instability
      of the entire system, which scattered the planetisimals and ultimately
      placed the gas giants in their current positions. During this period,
      the grand tack hypothesis suggests that a final inward migration of
      Jupiter dispersed much of the asteroid belt, leading to the Late Heavy
      Bombardment of the inner planets. Although this could destabilize the system and
      eventually lead millions of years later to expulsion of planets,
      collisions of planets, or planets hitting the Sun, it would most likely
      leave the Solar System much as it is today. The current Sun compared
      to its peak size in the red-giant phase The Sun's main-sequence phase,
      from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun
      compared to around two billion years for all other subsequent phases of
      the Sun's pre-remnant life combined. The Solar System will remain
      roughly as it is known today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun
      has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5
      billion years from now. Because of its increased surface area,
      the surface of the Sun will be cooler (2,600 K (4,220 °F) at its
      coolest) than it is on the main sequence.

    <b><u>Mercury</u>: Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is
      named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the
      gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of
      Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years.
      Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about one-third the diameter
      of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes
      system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.

      Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio. This
      relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to the stars". Consequently, one
      solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice the planet's sidereal year. This
      means that one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the
      next orbit, that side will be in darkness all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.</b>

      <U>Venus:</U>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and
      size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed
      mostly of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean temperature
      of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These extreme conditions
      compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical state at Venus's surface.

      Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus lacks an internal dynamo, and its weakly induced
      magnetosphere is caused by atmospheric interactions with the solar wind. Internal heat escapes through active
      volcanism,[21][22] resulting in resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar
      System, the other being Mercury, that have no moons.[23] Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been
      identified at its cloud layers. Venus may have had liquid surface water early in its history with a habitable
      environment,[24][25] before a runaway greenhouse effect evaporated any water and turned Venus into its present
      state.

      <u>Earth:</u>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. This is
      enabled by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost
      all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of
      Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land
      hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's
      polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's
      crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
      earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the
      destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

      <u>Mars:</u>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in
      iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[22][23] Mars is among the brightest objects in
      Earth's sky, and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing. It is
      classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System's planets with a diameter of
      6,779 km (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours, and a Martian
      solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites that are small and
      irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.

      <u>Jupiter:</u>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant
      with a mass more than 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than
      one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is eleven times that of Earth, and a tenth that of the Sun.
      Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86 years. It is the third
      brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since
      prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient Roman religion.

      <u>Saturn:</u>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
      It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.[27][28] It has an eighth the average
      density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.[29][30][31] Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter,
      Saturn has less than a third the mass of Jupiter. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of 9.59 AU (1,434 million
      km), with an orbital period of 29.45 years.

      <u>Uranus:</u>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the
      planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls "ice" or
      volatiles. The planet's atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature
      (49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F)) of all the Solar System's planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a
      retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around
      the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

      of Earth and slightly more massive, but denser and smaller, than fellow ice giant Uranus. Being composed primarily
      of gases and liquids,[21] it has no well-defined solid surface, and orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an
      orbital distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the
      Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's trident.
